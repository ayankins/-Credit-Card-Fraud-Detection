# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Python. The project utilizes a Logistic Regression model to analyze transaction data and predict the likelihood of fraud.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression, this project aims to identify patterns and anomalies in transaction data that indicate potential fraud.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess transaction data to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model using historical transaction data.
- **Prediction**: Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You'll also need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
